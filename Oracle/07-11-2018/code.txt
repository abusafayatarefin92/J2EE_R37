select last_name, to_char(hire_date, 'hh24:mi:ss am') MONTHS_HIRED from employees;
Using the To_Char Function with Dates
select last_name, to_char(hire_date, 'fmdd month yyyy') as HIREDATE from employees;
Using To_Char Function with Numbers
select last_name, to_char(salary * 100, '$99,99,999.00') SALARY from employees;
Using the To_Number and To_Date Functions
select last_name, hire_date from employees where hire_date = to_date('May 24, 2007', 'fmMonth dd, yyyy');
RR Date Formate: Example
select last_name, to_char(hire_date, 'dd-Mon-yyyy') from employees where hire_date < to_date('01-Jan-2008', 'dd-Mon-rr');
select last_name, to_char(hire_date, 'day/mon/yyyy') from employees where hire_date = to_date('Jun 17, 2003', 'fmMonth dd, yyyy');
Nesting Functions
select last_name, upper(concat(substr(last_name, 1, 3), '_US')) from employees where department_id = 60;
select last_name, substr(last_name, 1, 3), concat(substr(last_name, 1, 3), '_US'), upper(concat(substr(last_name, 1, 3), '_US')) from employees where department_id = 60;
select to_char(next_day(add_months(hire_date, 6), 'Friday'), 'fmDay, Month DDth, YYYY') "Next 6 Month Review" from employees order by hire_date;

select last_name, salary, commission_pct, (salary * 12) + (salary * 12 * commission_pct) AN_SAL from employees;
Using the NVL2 Function
select last_name, salary, commission_pct, nvl2(commission_pct, 'SAL + COMM', 'SAL') income from employees where department_id in (50, 80);
select last_name, salary, commission_pct, nvl2(commission_pct, salary + commission_pct, salary) as TOTAL from employees where department_id in (50, 80);
Using the NullIf Function
select first_name, length(first_name) "expr1", last_name, length(last_name) "expr2", nullif(length(first_name), length(last_name)) result from employees;
