//Find out errors from the following program
Puiblic clazz Helloworld(){
publik voed main(string [[ args){
system.out.printin(Hello World):
}
}

Errors:
In line-1 public, class, HelloWorld and we don't need '()' .
In line-2 public, we should type static, void, String because java is case sensetive, it '[]' should be like this.
In line-3 println, "Hello World" it should be in double quotation, at the end of the sentance we should give ';' .
