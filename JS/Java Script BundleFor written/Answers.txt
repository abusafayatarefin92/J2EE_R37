1.	Which operator can be used as an alternative of conditional statement?
Answer. Ternary operator can be used as an alternative of conditional statement. Ternary operator combine three expressions into one. Most commonly used to 
	create a shorthand expression for conditional statements, The only ternary operator in JavaScript is ?:. For example:
	if(a == b){
		c = "Ok!";
	}else{
		c = "Not Ok!";
	}
	This conditional statement can be written as follows:
	a == b ? c = "Ok!" : c = "Not Ok!";
2.	What are the three basic structure of JavaScript?
Answer. The three basic structure of JavaScript are:
	i. 	 Sequences;
	ii.  Branches;
	iii. Loops;
3.	What are the three categories of operators? 
Answer. The three categories of operators are:
	i.   binary;
	ii.  unary;
	iii. ternary.
	Binary operators, most commonly associated with the concept of operator, take two expressions and combine them into a third complex or compound expression.
	The divide (/) operator and the plus (+) operator are binary operators.
	Unary operators work on a single variable or literal. All negative numbers are assigned using a unary operator. Unary operators include increment or
	decrement operators (++ and --).
	Ternary operators combine three expressions into one. Most commonly used to create a shorthand expression for conditional statements. The only ternary 
	operator in JavaScript is ?:.
4.	Which loop checks the condition at the end of the statement?
Answer. The do/while loop checks the condition at the end of the statement. 
	Syntex: 
	do{
		Statements
		counter increment/decrement
	}while(condition);
5.	What are the three parts of for loop?
Answer. The three parts of for loop are: 
	i.   start value or initial value;
	ii.  condition;
	iii. increment/decrement;
	Syntex:
	for(initial value; condition; increment/decrement){
		Statements;
	}
6.	Where return statement is used?
Answer. Return statement is used as part of a function. The role of return statement is to provide the value of the expressions within the function. 
	For example:
	function returnMessage(){
		var part1 = "Good";
		var part2 = "Morning!";
		var wholeThing = part1 + " " + part2;
		return wholeThing
	}
	returnMessage();
	The Output will be: Good Morning!
7.	What is the benefit of using with statement?
Answer. The with statement is a shortcut. Because, using the with statement, we can specify the object name once and then follow it with all the properties and 
	their values. For example:
	function showEm(){
		with(document.customer){
			var a = fname.value;
			var b = lname.value;
			var c = address.value;
			var d = city.value;
			var e = state.value;
		}
		var fullName = a + " " + b + "\n";
		var livesHere = c + "\n" + d + ", " + e;
		var f = fullName + livesHere;
		return f;
	}
	showEm();
	The output will be: 
	Abc Def
	Dhanmondi
	Dhaka, Bangladesh
8.	How can you fire a function?
Answer. Event handlers launch a JavaScript function.
9.	What are the three main event categories?
Answer. The three main event categories are:
	i.   Keyboard and mouse events;
	ii.  Load events;
	iii. Form-related events.
