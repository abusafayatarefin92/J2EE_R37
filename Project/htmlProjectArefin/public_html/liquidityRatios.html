                    <h2>Liquidity Ratios</h2>
                    <p>The liquidity of a firm is measured by its ability to satisfy its short term obligations as they come due. Liquidity refers to the solvency of the firm’s overall financial position- the ease with which it can pay its bills. In general, the greater the coverage of liquid assets to short-term liabilities the better as it is a clear signal that a company can pay its debts that are coming due in the near future and still fund its ongoing operations. On the other hand, a company with a low coverage rate should raise a red flag for investors as it may be a sign that the company will have difficulty meeting running its operations, as well as meeting its obligations.
                        There are four ratios to measure the liquidity of a firm. They are Current Ratio, Quick Ratio, Cash Ratio and Cash Conversion Ratio. We have shown graphical presentation to compare these ratios between two companies: British American Tobacco Bangladesh Company Limited (BATBC) and Confidence Cement Limited (CCL).
                    </p><br/><br/>
                    <p>The Liquidity Ratios are given below:</p>
                    <h3>Current Ratio</h3>
                    <p>The current ratio is a liquidity ratio that measures a company's ability to pay short-term and long-term obligations. To gauge this ability, the current ratio considers the current total assets of a company (both liquid and illiquid) relative to that company’s current total liabilities. The current ratio is mainly used to give an idea of the company's ability to pay back its liabilities (debt and accounts payable) with its assets (cash, marketable securities, inventory, accounts receivable). The higher the current ratio, the more capable the company is of paying its obligations, as it has a larger proportion of asset value relative to the value of its liabilities.<br/>
                        For example:<br/>
                        <img src="images/currentRatio.jpg" width="50%" height="300px"/><br/>
                    <h4>Interpretation</h4>
                    In this graph we can see, the current ratio of CCL is better than the current ratio of BATBC.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Quick Ratio</h3>
                    <p>The quick ratio is a measure of how well a company can meet its short-term financial liabilities. Also known as the acid-test ratio, the quick ratio is a more conservative version of another well-known liquidity metric -- the current ratio. Although the two are similar, the quick ratio provides a more rigorous assessment of a company's ability to pay its current liabilities.<br/>
                        For example:<br/>
                        <img src="images/quickRatio.jpg" width="50%" height="300px"/><br/>
                    <h4>Interpretation</h4>
                    In this graph we can see, current ratio of CCL is better than the current ratio of BATBC.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Cash Ratio</h3>
                    <p>The cash ratio is an indicator of a company's liquidity that further refines both the current ratio and the quick ratio by measuring the amount of cash, cash equivalents or invested funds there are in current assets to cover current liabilities. All else equal, the higher the ratio, the greater the liquidity of the firm.<br/>
                        For example:<br/>
                        <img src="images/cashRatio.jpg" width="50%" height="300px"/><br/>
                    <h4>Interpretation</h4>
                    In this graph we can see, BATBC has the better cash ratio than CCL.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Cash Conversion Ratio</h3>
                    <p>The cash conversion cycle (CCC) is a metric that expresses the length of time, in days, that it takes for a company to convert resource inputs into cash flows. The cash conversion cycle attempts to measure the amount of time each net input dollar is tied up in the production and sales process before it is converted into cash through sales to customers. This metric looks at the amount of time needed to sell inventory, the amount of time needed to collect receivables and the length of time the company is afforded to pay its bills without incurring penalties. It gives us an indication as to how long it takes a company to collect cash from sales of inventory.<br/>
                        For example:<br/>
                        <img src="images/cashConversionCycle.jpg" width="50%" height="300px"/><br/>
                    <h4>Interpretation</h4>
                    In this graph, BATBC has the lower cash conversion cycle than CCL which is better for the company.
