                    <h2>Valuation Ratios</h2>
                    <p>Company valuation ratios. Valuation is the financial process of determining what a company is worth. Valuation ratios put that insight into the context of a company's share price, where they serve as useful tools for evaluating investment potential.
                    </p><br/><br/>
                    <p>The Valuation Ratios are given below:</p>
                    <h3>P/E Ratio</h3>
                    <p>The price/earnings ratio (PER) is the most widely used method for determining whether shares are “correctly” valued in relation to one another. But the PER does not in itself indicate whether the share is a bargain. The PER depends on the market’s perception of the risk and future growth in earnings. A company with a low PER indicates that the market perceives it as lower risk or lower growth or both as compared to a company with a higher PER. The PER of a listed company’s share is the result of the collective perception of the market as to how risky the company is and what its earnings growth prospects are in relation to that of other companies. Investors use the PER to compare their own perception of the risk and growth of a company against the market’s collective perception of the risk and growth as reflected in the current PER.<br/>

                    <h3>P/CF Ratio</h3>
                    <p>P/CF ratio is a ratio used to compare a company's market value to its cash flow. It is calculated by dividing the company's market cap by the company's operating cash flow in the most recent fiscal year (or the most recent four fiscal quarters); or, equivalently, divide the per-share stock price by the per-share operating cash flow. In theory, the lower a stock's price/cash flow ratio is, the better value that stock.
                        A high P/CF ratio indicated that the specific firm is trading at a high price but is not generating enough cash flows to support the multiple - sometimes this is OK, depending on the firm, industry, and its specific operations. Smaller price ratios are generally preferred, as they may reveal a firm generating ample cash flows that are not yet properly considered in the current share price. Holding all factors constant, from an investment perspective, a smaller P/CF is preferred over a larger multiple.<br/>
                        For example:<br/>

                    <h3>P/S Ratio</h3>
                    <p>PSR, is a valuation metric for stocks. It is calculated by dividing the company's market cap by the revenue in the most recent year; or, equivalently, divide the per-share stock price by the per-share revenue.
                        The smaller this ratio (i.e. less than 1.0) is usually thought to be a better investment since the investor is paying less for each unit of sales. However, sales do not reveal the whole picture, as the company may be unprofitable with a low P/S ratio. Because of the limitations, this ratio is usually used only for unprofitable companies, since they don't have a price–earnings ratio (P/E ratio). The metric can be used to determine the value of a stock relative to its past performance. It may also be used to determine relative valuation of a sector or the market as a whole.<br/>

                    <h3>P/BV Ratio</h3>
                    <p>P/B ratio, is a financial ratio used to compare a company's current market price to its book value. It is also sometimes known as a Market-to-Book ratio. The calculation can be performed in two ways, but the result should be the same each way. In the first way, the company's market capitalization can be divided by the company's total book value from its balance sheet. The second way, using per-share values, is to divide the company's current share price by the book value per share
                        This ratio also gives some idea of whether an investor is paying too much for what would be left if the company went bankrupt immediately. For companies in distress, the book value is usually calculated without the intangible assets that would have no resale value. In such cases, P/B should also be calculated on a "diluted" basis, because stock options may well vest on sale of the company or change of control or firing of management.<br/>

                    <h3>Dividend Per Share</h3>
                    <p>Dividend per share (DPS) is the sum of declared dividends issued by a company for every ordinary share outstanding. Dividend per share (DPS) is the total dividends paid out by a business, including interim dividends, divided by the number of outstanding ordinary shares issued. A company's DPS is usually derived using the dividend paid in the most recent quarter, which is also used to calculate the dividend yield.<br/>
                        For example:<br/>

                    <h3>Dividend Pay-out Ratio</h3>
                    <p>The part of the earnings not paid to investors is left for investment to provide for future earnings growth. Investors seeking high current income and limited capital growth prefer companies with high Dividend payout ratio. However investors seeking capital growth may prefer lower payout ratio because capital gains are taxed at a lower rate. High growth firms in early life generally have low or zero payout ratios. As they mature, they tend to return more of the earnings back to investors.<br/>
                        For example:<br/>

                    <h3>Retention Ratio</h3>
                    <p>Retention Ratio indicates the percentage of a company's earnings that are not paid out in dividends but credited to retained earnings. It is the opposite of the dividend payout ratio, so that also called the retention rate.
                        The payout ratio is the amount of dividends the company pays out divided by the net income. This formula can be rearranged to show that the retention ratio plus payout ratio equals 1, or essentially 100%. That is to say that the amount paid out in dividends plus the amount kept by the company comprises all of net income.<br/>
                        For example:<br/>

                    <h3>Sustainable Growth Rate</h3>
                    <p>The sustainable growth rate (SGR) is the maximum rate of growth that a firm can sustain without having to increase financial leverage or look for outside financing. The SGR is a measure of how large and how quickly a firm can grow without borrowing more money. After a firm has passed this rate, its growth will decline in the long term, and it must borrow funds to facilitate additional growth.<br/>
