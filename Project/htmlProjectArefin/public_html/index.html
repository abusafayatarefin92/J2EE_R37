                    <h2>Finance</h2>
                    <p>Finance describes the management, creation, and study of money, investments, and other financial instruments. Some people prefer to divide finance into three distinct categories: public finance, corporate finance, and personal finance. 
                        There is also the recently emerging area of social finance. Behavioral finance seeks to identify the cognitive (e.g. emotional, social, and psychological) reasons behind financial decisions. 

                    </p>

                    <h3>BREAKING DOWN 'Finance'</h3>
                    <p>Public finance includes tax systems, government expenditures, budget procedures, stabilization policy and instruments, debt issues, and other government concerns. Corporate finance involves managing assets, liabilities, revenues, and debts for a business. Personal finance defines all financial decisions and activities of an individual or household, including budgeting, insurance, mortgage planning, savings, and retirement planning.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Public Finance</h3>
                    <p>The federal government helps prevent market failure by overseeing the allocation of resources, distribution of income, and stabilization of the economy. Regular funding for these programs is secured mostly through taxation. Borrowing from banks, insurance companies, and other governments and earning dividends from its companies also help finance the federal government. State and local governments also receive grants and aid from the federal government. Other sources of public finance include user charges from ports, airport services, and other facilities; fines resulting from breaking laws; revenues from licenses and fees, such as for driving; and sales of government securities and bond issues.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Corporate Finance</h3>
                    <p>Businesses obtain financing through a variety of means, ranging from equity investments to credit arrangements. A firm might take out a loan from a bank or arrange for a line of credit. Acquiring and managing debt properly can help a company expand and become more profitable.

                        Startups may receive capital from angel investors or venture capitalists in exchange for a percentage of ownership. If a company thrives and goes public, it will issue shares on a stock exchange; such initial public offerings (IPO) bring a great influx of cash into a firm. Established companies may sell additional shares or issue corporate bonds to raise money. Businesses may purchase dividend-paying stocks, blue-chip bonds, or interest-bearing bank certificates of deposits (CD); they may also buy other companies in an effort to boost revenue.

                        For example, in July 2016, newspaper publishing company, Gannett, reported net income for the second quarter of $12.3 million, down 77% from $53.3 million during the 2015 second quarter. However, due to acquisitions of North Jersey Media Group and Journal Media Group in 2015, Gannett reported substantially greater circulation numbers in 2016, resulting in a 3% increase in total revenue to $748.8 million for the second quarter.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Personal Finance</h3>
                    <p>Personal financial planning generally involves analyzing an individual's or a family's current financial position, predicting short-term and long-term needs, and executing a plan to fulfill those need within individual financial constraints. Personal finance is a very personal activity that depends largely on one's earnings, living requirements, and individual goals and desires.

                        Matters of personal finance include, but are not limited to, the purchasing of financial products for personal reasons, like credit cards; life, health, and home insurance; mortgages; and retirement products. Personal banking (e.g. checking and savings accounts, IRAs, and 401(k) plans) is also considered a part of personal finance.<br/>
                        Among the most important aspects of personal finance are:<br/>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Assessing the current financial status: expected cash flow, current savings, etc.</li>
                        <li>Buying insurance to protect against risk and to ensure one's material standing is secure</li>
                        <li>Calculating and filing taxes</li>
                        <li>Savings and investments</li>
                        <li>Retirement planning</li>
                    </ul><br/>
                    As a specialized field, personal finance is a recent development, though forms of it have been taught in universities and schools as "home economics" or "consumer economics" since the early 20th century. The field was initially disregarded by male economists, as "home economics" appeared to be the purview of housewives. Recently, economists have repeatedly stressed widespread education in matters of personal finance as integral to the macro performance of the overall national economy.

                    <h3>Social Finance</h3>
                    <p>Social finance typically refers to investments made in social enterprises including charitable organizations and some cooperatives. Rather than an outright donation, these investments take the form of equity or debt financing, in which the investor seeks both a financial reward as well as a social gain.

                        Modern forms of social finance also include some segments of microfinance​, specifically loans to small business owners and entrepreneurs in less developed countries to enable their enterprises to grow. Lenders earn a return on their loans while simultaneously helping improve individuals' standard of living and benefiting the local society and economy.

                        Social impact bonds (also known as Pay for Success Bonds or social benefit bonds) are a specific type of instrument that acts as a contract with the public sector or local government. Repayment and return on investment are contingent upon the achievement of certain social outcomes and achievements.

                    <h2>Financial Ratios</h2>
                    <p>Financial ratios are relationships determined from a company's financial information and used for comparison purposes.</p>
                    <img src="images/financialRatios.jpg" width="80%" height="500px"/><br/><br/>
                    <p>
                        Fundamental analysis is an analytical method investors use to value companies based on a study of corporate profitability and financial measures. One way to do this is to look at the general, qualitative factors of a company – for example what industry or sector the company is in, who are their competitors, and if they have a recognizable brand name. Another approach to fundamental analysis considers tangible and measurable quantitative factors. This means, for instance, crunching the numbers and closely analyzing financial statements such as the balance sheet and income statement. When used in conjunction with other methods, quantitative analysis can produce excellent results and give patient investors an edge over time.<br/><br/>
                        Ratio analysis is one way to make sense of these corporate data. Looking at ratios is more involved than simply comparing different figures from the balance sheet, income statement and cash flow statement. It requires relating these calculated ratios against previous years, other companies, the industry the company is in, and even the economy at large. Ratios can give you a glimpse into the relationships among and between individual values that relate to a company’s operations and link them to how a company has performed in the past, and how it might perform in the future. The result is a potentially robust method of valuing the shares of a company.
