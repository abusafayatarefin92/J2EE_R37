                    <h2>Profitability Ratios</h2>
                    <p>Profitability ratios are a class of financial metrics that are used to assess a business's ability to generate earnings compared to its expenses and other relevant costs incurred during a specific period of time. For most of these ratios, having a higher value relative to a competitor's ratio or relative to the same ratio from a previous period indicates that the company is doing well.
                        Some industries experience seasonality in their operations. The retail industry, for example, typically experiences higher revenues and earnings for the Christmas season. It would not be useful to compare a retailer's fourth-quarter profit margin with its first-quarter profit margin. Comparing a retailer's fourth-quarter profit margin with the profit margin from the same period a year before would be far more informative.
