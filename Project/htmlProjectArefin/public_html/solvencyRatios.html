                    <h2>Solvency Ratios</h2>
                    <p>Solvency ratios, also called leverage ratios, measure a company's ability to sustain operations indefinitely by comparing debt levels with equity, assets, and earnings. In other words, solvency ratios identify going concern issues and a firm's ability to pay its bills in the long term. Many people confuse solvency ratios with liquidity ratios. Although they both measure the ability of a company to pay off its obligations, solvency ratios focus more on the long-term sustainability of a company instead of the current liability payments. Better solvency ratios indicate a more creditworthy and financially sound company in the long-term.
                        There are six ratios to measure the solvency of a firm. They are Debt to Asset Ratio, Debt to Equity Ratio, Debt to Capital Ratio, Financial Leverage, Interest Coverage Ratio and Fixed Charge Coverage. Here, we have shown the graphical presentation to compare these ratios between two companies (BATBC and CCL).

                    <p>The Solvency Ratios are given below:</p>
                    <h3>Debt to Asset</h3>
                    <p>Total debt to total assets is a leverage ratio that defines the total amount of debt relative to assets. This enables comparisons of leverage to be made across different companies. All else equal, the higher the ratio, the higher the degree of leverage, and consequently, financial risk. This is a broad ratio that includes long-term and short-term debt (borrowings maturing within one year), as well as all assets – tangible and intangible.<br/>
                        For example:<br/>
                        <img src="images/debtToAssetRatio.JPG" width="70%" height="400px"/><br/>
                    <h4>Interpretation</h4>
                    In this graph, we can see CCL has the more financial risk than BATBC because CCL has the greater debt to asset ratio than BATBC.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Debt to Equity</h3>
                    <p>Debt/Equity Ratio is a debt ratio used to measure a company's financial leverage, calculated by dividing a company’s total liabilities by its stockholders' equity. The D/E ratio indicates how much debt a company is using to finance its assets relative to the amount of value represented in shareholders’ equity. A high debt/equity ratio generally means that a company has been aggressive in financing its growth with debt. Aggressive leveraging practices are often associated with high levels of risk. This may result in volatile earnings as a result of the additional interest expense.<br/>
                        For example:<br/>
                        <img src="images/debtToEquityRatio.JPG" width="70%" height="400px"/><br/>
                    <h4>Interpretation</h4>
                    In this graph we can see, CCL has the higher level of risk than BATBC. Because CCL has the higher debt to equity ratio than BATBC.
                    </p>
                
                <h3>Debt to Capital Ratio</h3>
                <p>The debt-to-capital ratio is calculated by taking the company's debt, including both short- and long-term liabilities and dividing it by the total capital. Total capital is all debt plus shareholders' equity, which may include items such as common stock, preferred stock and minority interest. The debt-to-capital ratio gives analysts and investors a better idea of a company's financial structure and whether or not the company is a suitable investment. All else equal, the higher the debt-to-capital ratio, the riskier the company.<br/>
                    For example:<br/>
                    <img src="images/debtToCapitalRatio.JPG" width="70%" height="400px"/><br/>
                <h4>Interpretation</h4>
                In this graph we can see CCL has a higher risk than BATBC. Because, CCL has the greater debt to capital ratio.
                </p>
                <h3>Financial Leverage</h3>
                <p>Financial leverage is defined as total assets divided by total shareholders' equity. The higher the ratio, the more debt a company uses in its capital structure.<br/>
                    For example:<br/>
                    <img src="images/financialLeverage.JPG" width="70%" height="400px"/><br/>
                <h4>Interpretation</h4>
                According to this graph, BATBC has more financial leverage than CCL. Because, BATBC uses more debt in their capital structure.
                </p>
                <h3>Interest Coverage Ratio</h3>
                <p>The interest coverage ratio is used to determine how easily a company can pay interest expenses on outstanding debt. The ratio is calculated by dividing a company's earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) by the company's interest expenses for the same period. The lower the ratio, the more the company is burdened by debt expense. When a company's interest coverage ratio is only 1.5 or lower, its ability to meet interest expenses may be questionable.<br/>
                    For example:<br/>
                    <img src="images/interestCoverageRatio.JPG" width="70%" height="400px"/><br/>
                <h4>Interpretation</h4>
                BATBC has the higher interest coverage ratio than CCL.So BATBC has the capacity to take more loan than CCL.
                </p>
                <h3>Fixed Charge Coverage</h3>
                <p>The fixed charge coverage ratio is a financial ratio that measures a firm's ability to pay all of its fixed charges or expenses with its income before interest and income taxes.<br/>
